    "The `window` transform performs calculations over sorted groups of data records. Window transforms are quite powerful, supporting tasks such as ranking, lead/lag analysis, cumulative totals, and running sums or averages. Values calculated by a `window` transform are written back to the input data table as new fields. Window operations include the aggregate operations we've seen earlier, as well as specialized operations such as `rank`, `row_number`, `lead`, and `lag`. The Vega-Lite documentation lists [all valid window operations](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/window.html#ops).\n",

How can we limit the display to the top 20?\n",

For example, think of a histogram in which each bin includes not only its own count but also the counts from all previous bins &mdash; the result is a _running total_, with the last bin containing the total number of records. A cumulative chart directly shows us, for a given reference value, how many data values are less than or equal to that reference.\n",
